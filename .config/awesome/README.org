#+Title: Awesomewm Config
#+Author: Soumava Seal
#+Description: This repo contains the config files for my personal build of awesomewm.

* Config for Awesomewm :

  Awesomewm is an extensible and highly customizable window manager written in lua. This repository contains my configuration files for awesomewm.
  
** Note :

   This configuration is based on the repo [[https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats][awesome-copycats]]. I modified mainly two files of this repo "./rc.lua" and "./themes/powerarrow-dark/theme.lua". I also used [[https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets][awesome-wm-widgets]] and [[https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-buttons][awesome-buttons]] repository.

   *PS: This is currently in a very initial stage and some of the things may not work at the moment.*
